# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to determine how many employees are expected to retire in the coming years in order to prepare the company for future wellbeing and success.

## Results
* We determined that 25,916	Senior Engineers, 24,926 Senior Staff, 9,285 Engineers, 7,636	Staff, 3,603 Technique Leaders, 1,090 Assistant Engineers, and 2 Managers are expected to retire soon (a total of 72,458 employees).
* 36% of employees expected to retire soon are Senior Engineers and 34% of employees expected to retire soon are Senior Staff.
* 70% of employees expected to retire soon hold Senior positions, making internal growth from entry-level positions to Senior positions crucial.
* We determined that 1,550 current employees are eligble to be mentors in the mentorship program.

## Summary
72,458 positions will need to be filled in the next 5-10 years as these employees begin to retire.
Internal growth is crucial to fill many of these high-level positions. A mentorship program, while a good idea, will not prove sufficient due to the low number of employees eligable to be mentors (1,550). Even if these mentors only focus on mentoring employees looking to fill Senior positions, 1,550 mentors mentoring one employee each means that only 3% of the potential employees to fill the Senior positions will have mentors.
